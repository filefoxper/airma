# Install and support

The package lives in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). To install the latest stable version, run the following command:

## Install command

```
npm i @airma/react-hooks
```

## Browser support

```
chrome: '>=58',
edge: '>=16',
firefox: '=>57',
safari: '>=11'
```

If you want to support older browser versions, you'd better have your own polyfills.
